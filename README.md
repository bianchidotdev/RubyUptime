## Ruby Uptime

RubyUptime is a simple, extensible open-source uptime monitoring tool. It is very much in development right now, but we have 3 main goals/motivations:

1. Allow for fine-grained control of health checks out of the box with intuitive configuration
2. Allow for simple web-hook based integrations with dynamic content in the cases of failures
3. Target a simple deployment mechanism regardless of platform needed
